For example, the mkdocs and     readthedocs themes have each added a new <code>theme.analytics.gtag</code>     configuration option which uses the new Google Analytics 4 property. See     Google's documentation on how to Upgrade to a Google Analytics 4     property.

The typical action that plugins can do with these is to call     <code>server.watch(some_dir, builder)</code>, which basically adds that directory to     watched directories, causing the site to be rebuilt on file changes.

In other     words, The index page will be listed as the first child of a directory, while     all other documents are sorted alphanumerically by file name after the index     page (#73 &amp; #1042).</li> <li>A <code>README.md</code> file is now treated as an index file within a directory and     will be rendered to <code>index.html</code> (#608).</li> <li>The URLs for all files are computed once and stored in a files collection.     This ensures all internal links are always computed correctly regardless of     the configuration. This also allows all internal links to be validated, not     just links to other Markdown pages. (#842 &amp; #872).</li> <li>A new url template filter smartly ensures all URLs are relative to the     current page (#1526).</li> <li>An on_files plugin event has been added, which could be used to include     files not in the <code>docs_dir</code>, exclude files, redefine page URLs (i.e.     implement extensionless URLs), or to manipulate files in various other ways.</li> </ul>","title":"Internal Refactor of Pages, Files, and Navigation"},{"location":"about/release-notes/#backward-incompatible-changes","text":"<p>As part of the internal refactor, a number of backward incompatible changes have been introduced, which are summarized below.</p>","title":"Backward Incompatible Changes"},{"location":"about/release-notes/#urls-have-changed-when-use_directory_urls-is-false","text":"<p>Previously, all Markdown pages would be have their filenames altered to be index pages regardless of how the use_directory_urls setting was configured.

When MkDocs builds a site with translations, it only makes use of the binary <code>mo</code> files(s) for the specified locale. Therefore, when packaging a theme, you would need to make the following addition to your <code>MANIFEST.in</code> file:</p> <pre><code>recursive-include theme_name *.mo</code></pre> <p>Then, before building your Python package, you will want to ensure that the binary <code>mo</code> file for each locale is up-to-date by running the <code>compile_catalog</code> command for each locale.

Specifically, the markdown_extensions and plugins options must use the alternative syntax which does not use list items (lines which start with  <code>-</code>).</p> <p>For example, suppose the common (parent) configuration is defined in <code>base.yml</code>:</p> <pre><code>theme:\n    name: mkdocs\n    locale: en\n    highlightjs: true\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    toc:\n        permalink: true\n    admonition: {}</code></pre> <p>Then, for the \"foo\" site, the primary configuration file would be defined at <code>foo/mkdocs.yml</code>:</p> <pre><code>INHERIT: ../base.yml\nsite_name: Foo Project\nsite_url: https://example.com/foo</code></pre> <p>When running <code>mkdocs build</code>, the file at <code>foo/mkdocs.yml</code> would be passed in as the configuration file. MkDocs will then parse that file, retrieve and parse the parent file <code>base.yml</code> and deep merge the two.

For example, suppose for one site you wanted to add support for definition lists, use a different symbol for permalinks, and define a different separator. In that site's primary configuration file you could do:</p> <pre><code>INHERIT: ../base.yml\nsite_name: Bar Project\nsite_url: https://example.com/bar\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    def_list: {}\n    toc:\n        permalink: \uf0c1\n        separator: \"_\"</code></pre> <p>In that case, the above configuration would be deep merged with <code>base.yml</code> and result in the following configuration:</p> <pre><code>site_name: Bar Project\nsite_url: https://example.com/bar\n\ntheme:\n    name: mkdocs\n    locale: en\n    highlightjs: true\n\nmarkdown_extensions:\n    def_list: {}\n    toc:\n        permalink: \uf0c1\n        separator: \"_\"\n    admonition: {}</code></pre> <p>Notice that the <code>admonition</code> extension was retained from the parent configuration, the <code>def_list</code> extension was added, the value of <code>toc.permalink</code> was replaced, and the value of <code>toc.separator</code> was added.</p> <p>You can replace or merge the value of any key. However, any non-key is always replaced. Therefore, you cannot append items to a list. You must redefine the entire list.</p> <p>As the nav configuration is made up of nested lists, this means that you cannot merge navigation items. Of course, you can replace the entire <code>nav</code> configuration with a new one. However, it is generally expected that the entire navigation would be defined in the primary configuration file for a project.</p>  <p>Warning</p> <p> As a reminder, all path based configuration options must be relative to the primary configuration file and MkDocs does not alter the paths when merging. Therefore, defining paths in a parent file which is inherited by multiple different sites may not work as expected.

If not provided, the navigation will be automatically created by discovering all the Markdown files in the documentation directory. An automatically created navigation configuration will always be sorted alphanumerically by file name (except that index files will always be listed first within a sub-section). You will need to manually define your navigation configuration if you would like your navigation menu sorted differently.</p> <p>A minimal navigation configuration could look like this:</p> <pre><code>nav:\n    - 'index.md'\n    - 'about.md'</code></pre> <p>All paths in the navigation configuration must be relative to the <code>docs_dir</code> configuration option. If that option is set to the default value, <code>docs</code>, the source files for the above configuration would be located at <code>docs/index.md</code> and <code>docs/about.md</code>.</p> <p>The above example will result in two navigation items being created at the top level and with their titles inferred from the contents of the Markdown file or, if no title is defined within the file, of the file name. To override the title in the <code>nav</code> setting add a title right before the filename.</p> <pre><code>nav:\n    - Home: 'index.md'\n    - About: 'about.md'</code></pre> <p>Note that if a title is defined for a page in the navigation, that title will be used throughout the site for that page and will override any title defined within the page itself.</p> <p>Navigation sub-sections can be created by listing related pages together under a section title. For example:</p> <pre><code>nav:\n    - Home: 'index.md'\n    - 'User Guide':\n        - 'Writing your docs': 'writing-your-docs.md'\n        - 'Styling your docs': 'styling-your-docs.md'\n    - About:\n        - 'License': 'license.md'\n        - 'Release Notes': 'release-notes.md'</code></pre> <p>With the above configuration we have three top level items: \"Home\", \"User Guide\" and \"About.\" \"Home\" is a link to the homepage for the site. Under the \"User Guide\" section two pages are listed: \"Writing your docs\" and \"Styling your docs.\" Under the \"About\" section two more pages are listed: \"License\" and \"Release Notes.\"</p> <p>Note that a section cannot have a page assigned to it. Sections are only containers for child pages and sub-sections. You may nest sections as deeply as you like. However, be careful that you don't make it too difficult for your users to navigate through the site navigation by over-complicating the nesting. While sections may mirror your directory structure, they do not have to.</p> <p>Any pages not listed in your navigation configuration will still be rendered and included with the built site, however, they will not be linked from the global navigation and will not be included in the <code>previous</code> and <code>next</code> links. Such pages will be \"hidden\" unless linked to directly.</p>","title":"Configure Pages and Navigation"},{"location":"user-guide/writing-your-docs/#writing-with-markdown","text":"<p>MkDocs pages must be authored in Markdown, a lightweight markup language which results in easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text documents that can be converted to valid HTML documents in a predictable manner.</p> <p>MkDocs uses the Python-Markdown library to render Markdown documents to HTML.

Default: <code>1</code>.</p> <p>This setting allows the header levels to be automatically adjusted to fit within the hierarchy of your HTML templates.
